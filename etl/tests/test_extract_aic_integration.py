    Test that we can fetch a real AIC artwork from their API and store it correctly.

    This test uses the REAL AIC API (no mocking) to verify the extraction pipeline
    works end-to-end. This catches API changes that would break production.

    Tests:
    - Real API call works (catches API downtime or schema changes)
    - Listing endpoint works correctly
    - Data is stored in database correctly
    - Idempotency: running twice doesn't create duplicates

    Potential bugs this could catch:
    - AIC API schema changed
    - Listing endpoint parameter syntax broken
    - Database unique constraint broken
    - Update/create logic broken
    - API client error handling issues
