    Test that image loading correctly updates database state and respects idempotency.

    This test uses real database operations but mocks S3 upload to avoid
    expensive external dependencies.

    Tests:
    - Fetch real SMK artwork (extraction step)
    - Transform to TransformedData (transformation step)
    - Process image loading (load step)
    - Database flag `image_loaded` is correctly updated
    - Idempotency: processing twice doesn't re-upload

    Potential bugs this could catch:
    - image_loaded flag not being set after processing
    - Database update transaction failing
    - Idempotency broken (reprocessing when shouldn't)
    - Service integration issues (ImageLoadService â†’ BucketService)
