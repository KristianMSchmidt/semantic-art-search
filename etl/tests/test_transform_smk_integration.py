    """
    Test that we can transform a real SMK artwork from MetaDataRaw to TransformedData.

    This test uses real SMK API data (no mocking) to verify the transformation pipeline
    works end-to-end with actual museum data structures.

    Tests:
    - Fetch real artwork from SMK API
    - Store in MetaDataRaw (extraction step)
    - Transform to TransformedData (transformation step)
    - Required fields are correctly extracted
    - Idempotency: transforming twice doesn't create duplicates

    Potential bugs this could catch:
    - SMK JSON schema changed (breaking field extraction)
    - Transformer not extracting required fields
    - Database unique constraint broken
    - Update/create logic broken
    - Type conversion errors (dates, lists, etc.)
